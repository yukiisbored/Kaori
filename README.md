## What is this?
This is a game framework that I wrote in Go. It focuses on flexibility, simplicity, and modularity. Kaori is made to be free of rigid laws and rules that most game engines / frameworks has and gives programmers the freedom to form the structure of the game to whatever they want.

## Features
* Scene System
* Texture Management
* Input Handler
* Game Loader for PC
* And more ( in the near future ) ...

## Disclaimer
English is **not** my native language and I'm sorry If there's a grammar error. I **don't** consider this as a "high-priority" project and because I'm a Senior High Student, I can **only** code on my free time. I **dont** consider myself as a "professional" and neither should you. I made this project just because I can and for the sake of anti-boredom.

Thanks,
